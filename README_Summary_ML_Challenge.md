# SUMMARY - Machine Learning Homework
# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

### July/19/2020: Gretel HW Tips
1. Choose 1 single Jupyter Notebook for all Models
2. Instead of MinMaxScalar you can use "Standard Scalar"

### Models tried for this Challenge

* LinearRegression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

### Summary Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
